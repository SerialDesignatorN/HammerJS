# HammerJS
Simple 3d editor made with HTML5 and Adobe Spectrum UI. Known as a third-party editor for Horang Hill.

## Why flooded with CSS?
Well, Javascript wasn't implemented yet, because I am trying to design the UI first, then work on the Javascripts.

# Installation
`yarn` and `yarn start`. That's all.
